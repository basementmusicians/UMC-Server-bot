$title[1;Chord Progression Formulae] 
$description[1;Chord progression formulae may appear to be a difficult math equation at first glance. However, they're not as difficult as you may believe. Roman numerals, which represent notes in a scale, are used to show these charts.
It'll make coming up with root notes a lot easier. Keep in mind that these formulas are tools, not rules. You'll come up with chord progressions that sound really nice and natural if you follow these guidelines.]

$title[1;Interpreting Guitar Chord Charts] 
$description[1;One of the first skills a guitarist should learn is how to read guitar chord charts. However, newbies may mistake the lines, numbers, and symbols for math rather than music.
Three or more separate notes are played together to form a chord. An interval, often known as a double-stop, is two separate notes played together.
Your guitar strings are represented by the vertical lines on the guitar chart. Because the chart is a vertical display and you're gazing down at your instrument horizontally, it might be difficult for novices to get the feel of it.
The horizontal lines on your guitar's neck symbolise the fret bars.
The dots indicate where your fingers should be placed on the fretboard. They're positioned on a vertical line to indicate the correct string, and inside the fret boxes to indicate which fret to press for that string. If there isn't a dot on the fretboard, that signifies you shouldn't touch that string.
Sometimes there will be numbers in the dots, or numbers will be seen beneath the chart.
Numbers can be found at the bottom of the chart or among the dots. Each of your fingers is represented by a number. A number next to a vertical line indicates which finger should be used on that string.
X means to avoid strumming the string at all or mute it.
O means to strum the string open, which means donâ€™t press it onto the fretboard. 
And lastly, the letters at the top of the chord chart are the name of the chord.]
